## Description:

Create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. Using Express.js as the backend, the application must save and retrieve nbote data from the JSON file. The applications front end has already been created, therefore the back end must be created by yours truly and connected to the exisiting front end, then the application must be deployed via Heroku.
